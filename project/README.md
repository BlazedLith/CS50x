Features

Create a countdown:
 Users can easily create a countdown timer by entering the date and time of the event or deadline and giving the event a name. The web app ensures  valid input, preventing users from setting  countdowns with missing or incorrect information. This feature ensures that the countdown is set correctly.

Countdown screen:
 Once the countdown is created, it will be displayed as a table  on the website. Each countdown is represented as a row in a table, with columns for the event name, time remaining, progress bar, and action buttons. This layout provides users with a clear and organized way to view and manage their countdown timers.

Progress bar:
 The countdown timer includes a dynamic progress bar that visually represents the time remaining until the event or deadline. Over time, the progress bar will shrink, helping users quickly display the remaining time visually. This feature improves user engagement and keeps them informed about upcoming deadlines.

Action button:
 Each countdown line includes action buttons for pause, resume, and delete. These buttons allow the user to control the countdown behavior. Users can pause and resume countdowns as needed, and they can delete countdowns that are no longer relevant. The delete button is designed to clear each countdown individually, preventing accidental deletion of all countdowns.

Warning:
 The web application will send a warning message to the user when the countdown timer ends.

User-friendly interface:
 The web app is designed with a user-friendly interface, including responsive input fields, clear button labels, and aesthetic design. This design choice ensures that users can easily navigate and interact with the app without any confusion.

Design selection

Progress bar behavior:
 To improve user experience,  progress bar behavior has been improved to provide a more accurate representation of the countdown. Its size now  decreases over time, giving users a real-time visual indication of how much time is left.

Delete button function:
 The delete button has been changed to clear  the specific countdown  associated with it, preventing accidental deletion of all countdowns. This design choice is intended to improve user satisfaction and prevent data loss.

Conclusion:
 The Countdown Timer web app provides a feature-rich, user-friendly  solution for managing and tracking important events and deadlines. The intuitive design, progress bar, and voice alert capabilities make it a valuable tool for individuals and professionals. Whether used for personal reminders or project management, this web app provides a simple yet effective way to stay organized and informed.
